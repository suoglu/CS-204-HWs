# Image-Median-Filtering
Simple programme that applies median filter to a matrix

## How to use:

1. First provide desired filter size. Filter size should be odd positive integer.
2. Program ask for a file location. Provide it.
3. Both input matrix and filtered matrix will be printed to console


## Input file rules:

* Input file should be a matrix, meaning each row should be at same size. 
* In the same row, columns should be seperated from each other with at least one space (more than one space is okey). 
* Next rows should be seperated with end line character ('\n'). 
* Matrix data should be positive integer between [0-255].

If input file fails to satisfy any of these rules, programme will give an error accordingly.
